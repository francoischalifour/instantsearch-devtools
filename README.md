# InstantSearch Devtools

> ðŸš§ This project is an experimentation and works with a [patched version of InstantSearch.js](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/tree/400a0948d734e9bcb6e29dff5115989a59c845c1).

Tools for visualizing the InstantSearch state on any production app.

## How it works

This works by injecting a middleware to InstantSearch.js to plug the `window.__INSTANTSEARCH_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_MIDDLEWARE__` middleware if present. This middleware is part of the visualizer tool that will be exposed as a browser extension in the future.

Once this patched InstantSearch detects that this middleware is available, it hooks it into its lifecycle and notifies it of every change.
